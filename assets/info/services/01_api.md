#### type

The type of the service.

#### tag

The tag of the endpoint.


#### secret

Secret for the API.

Clients authenticate with the standard `authorization: Bearer <secret>` gRPC metadata header.

If empty, authentication is disabled.

#### access_control_allow_origin

CORS allowed origins, `*` will be used if empty.

#### access_control_allow_private_network

Allow access from private network.

#### dashboard

Web dashboard downloaded and served over the API listener at `/dashboard/`; other browser
requests are redirected to it.

!!! info ""

    The object can be replaced with a boolean value (equivalent to `{ "enabled": <bool> }`),
    or with a string path (equivalent to `{ "enabled": true, "path": "<string>" }`).

#### dashboard.enabled

Enable the dashboard.

#### dashboard.path

Directory the dashboard files are stored in.

`dashboard` in the working directory will be used by default.

If the directory is empty, the dashboard is downloaded and an `.etag` file is stored inside
it to skip unchanged updates. A non-empty directory without an `.etag` file is served as-is
and never updated automatically.

#### dashboard.download_url

Download URL of the dashboard archive (zip).

`https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box-dashboard/archive/refs/heads/gh-pages.zip` will be used by default.

#### dashboard.http_client

HTTP client used to download the dashboard, with the same behavior as remote rule-sets.

See [HTTP Client Fields](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/configuration/shared/http-client/) for details.

When empty, the default HTTP client is used: the one named by
[`default_http_client`](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/configuration/route/#default_http_client), or the first top-level
`http_clients` entry when `default_http_client` is empty.

!!! failure "Implicit default deprecated in sing-box 1.14.0"

    When neither `http_clients` nor `default_http_client` is configured, an implicit HTTP
    client connecting through the default outbound is used. This implicit default is
    deprecated in sing-box 1.14.0 and will be removed in sing-box 1.16.0; define
    `http_clients` instead.

#### dashboard.update_interval

Update interval of the dashboard.

`1d` will be used by default.

#### tls

TLS configuration, see [TLS](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/configuration/shared/tls/#inbound).
